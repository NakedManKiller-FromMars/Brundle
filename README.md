# Brundle
Brundle is an R package that provides a series of functions for the normalisation of ChIP-Seq data
to internal or external controls. 

It is supported by the data package [BrudleData](https://github.com/andrewholding/BrundleData).

[Brundle_Example](https://github.com/andrewholding/Brundle_Example) provides worked examples and preprocessing scripts for people who want to use Brundle in their own research. The examples are also packaged as a [Docker Container](http://dockerhub.com/andrewholding/brundle) pre-installed with all the tools to run the examples and pipeline. You can find [instructions on running the container](https://github.com/andrewholding/Brundle_Example/blob/master/README.md#using-docker-container) in the [Brundle_Example](https://github.com/andrewholding/Brundle_Example/blob/master/README.md) readme. The Dockerfile and other relavent code for generating the container can be found in the [BrundleDocker](https://github.com/andrewholding/BrundleDocker) repository.
